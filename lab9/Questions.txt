1) By default, the Django REST framework uses http basic authentication. This can be managed in settings.py, under REST_FRAMEWORK with the tag DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES.

2) httpie also uses http basic authentication when using the -a or --auth flags. 

3) Session Authentication provides a Django User instance which contains user information. This information is then used to authenticate requests. The session itself is generated and stored on teh server.  Token authentication requires a unique token that is generated by the server and then stored by the user. The user then has to provide that token with each new request. Token is an improvement over Basic because it is generally more secure for the user; it doesn't give away the user's password.

4) First, the user tries to log in to an App. The app may then ask the user to link to another service for authentication. The user responds, and then the app sends a request to the service for authorization. The service returns an authorization page to the app which is displayed to the user. The user logs into the service and approves the authorization request. The service then provides the app with an authorization token, which the app can now use to authorize the user.
